Students get an AI assistant that helps them understand course content.

## How it works

While taking a course, students can chat with the assistant. It:

- Answers questions about the current lesson
- Explains concepts from videos and documents
- Helps with quiz preparation
- Suggests related content

The assistant only knows about the course content, not general knowledge.

## What it can access

For the current course, the assistant can read:

- Video transcripts
- Document text
- Quiz questions and explanations
- Module and lesson descriptions

## Student experience

Students click the chat icon while viewing any lesson. They can:

- Ask questions in natural language
- Upload images for context
- Reference specific video timestamps
- Get explanations in their preferred language

## Configure the assistant

Go to **Site > AI** to customize:

- **Name**: What to call the assistant
- **Tone**: Professional, friendly, or casual
- **Language**: Default response language
- **Custom instructions**: Additional behavior guidelines

## Enable/disable

The AI assistant can be enabled or disabled per campus in your plan settings.
