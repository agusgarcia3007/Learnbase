## Automatic transcription

When you upload a video, Learnbase can automatically:

- Generate a transcript of the audio
- Suggest a title and description based on the content

This helps with:

- Accessibility for hearing-impaired students
- Search within video content
- AI assistant context

## Video details

For each video you can configure:

- **Title**: The name shown to students
- **Description**: Additional context about the lesson
- **Duration**: Automatically detected from the file

## Tips
