Instead of `yourcampus.learnbase.lat`, you can use your own domain like `courses.yourcompany.com`.

## Requirements

- A domain you own
- Access to your domain's DNS settings

## Setup steps

### 1. Add your domain

1. Go to **Site > Configuration**
2. Find the **Custom Domain** section
3. Enter your domain (e.g., `courses.yourcompany.com`)
4. Click **Save**

### 2. Configure DNS

Add a CNAME record in your domain provider:

| Type | Name | Value |
|------|------|-------|
| CNAME | courses | domains.learnbase.lat |

Replace `courses` with your subdomain.

### 3. Verify

1. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 24 hours)
2. Click **Verify** in Learnbase
3. Once verified, SSL certificate is automatically provisioned

## Troubleshooting

**Verification failing?**

- Check the CNAME record is correct
- Wait a bit longer for DNS propagation
- Make sure there's no conflicting A record

**SSL not working?**

SSL is provisioned automatically after verification. It may take a few minutes.

## Remove custom domain

To go back to the default subdomain:

1. Go to **Site > Configuration**
2. Click **Remove** next to your custom domain
