## How enrollment works

Students can enroll in courses in two ways:

### Self-enrollment

Students browse your catalog, select a course, and enroll themselves. If the course is paid, they complete checkout first.

### Manual enrollment

Administrators can enroll students directly:

1. Go to **Management > Enrollments**
2. Click **New Enrollment**
3. Select the student and course
4. Save

## View enrollments

Go to **Management > Enrollments** to see:

- All enrollments in your campus
- Filter by course or student
- Enrollment date and progress

## Remove enrollment

If you need to remove a student from a course:

1. Find the enrollment
2. Click the delete button
3. Confirm

The student will lose access to the course content but their progress data is kept.

## Batch enrollment

For adding multiple students at once:

1. Use the shopping cart feature
2. Add multiple courses
3. Complete checkout to enroll in all at once
