## How progress works

Learnbase automatically tracks student progress:

- **Videos**: Progress saved based on watch time
- **Documents**: Marked complete when opened
- **Quizzes**: Marked complete when submitted

## Progress states

Each content item can be:

- **Not started**: Student hasn't accessed it yet
- **In progress**: Student has started but not finished
- **Completed**: Student has finished the item

## Course completion

A course is completed when all items in all modules are marked as complete.

When a student completes a course:
- The progress shows 100%
- A certificate is generated (if enabled)
- The completion is recorded

## View progress
