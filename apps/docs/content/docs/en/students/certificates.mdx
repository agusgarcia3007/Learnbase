## How certificates work

When a student completes 100% of a course with certificates enabled, a certificate is automatically generated.

The certificate includes:

- Student name
- Course name
- Completion date
- Unique verification code
- QR code for verification

## Enable certificates

For each course:

1. Go to **Content > Courses**
2. Edit the course
3. Enable **Include Certificate**
4. Save

## Customize certificates

Go to **Site > Configuration** to customize:

- **Signature**: Upload your signature image
- **Signer name**: Who signs the certificate
- **Custom message**: Additional text on the certificate

## Verification

Each certificate has a unique code and QR. Anyone can verify a certificate:

1. Visit `yourcampus.learnbase.lat/verify/CODE`
2. Or scan the QR code

The verification page shows if the certificate is valid.

## Send by email

Certificates can be sent to the student's email:

1. Go to the student's certificate
2. Click **Send by Email**

## Regenerate

If you need to update a certificate (e.g., student changed their name):

1. Go to the certificate
2. Click **Regenerate**

The verification code remains the same.
