## Course states

A course can be:

- **Draft**: Only visible to administrators. Use this while you're building the course.
- **Published**: Visible to everyone in the catalog. Students can enroll.

## Before publishing

Make sure your course has:

- A clear title and description
- At least one module with content
- A thumbnail image
- The correct price (or free)

## Publish your course

1. Go to **Content > Courses**
2. Find your course
3. Change the status from **Draft** to **Published**

The course will immediately appear in your campus catalog.

## Unpublish

If you need to make changes or temporarily hide a course:

1. Change the status back to **Draft**
2. Currently enrolled students will keep their access
3. New enrollments won't be possible until you publish again
