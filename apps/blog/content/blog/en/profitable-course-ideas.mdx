Picking the wrong topic is the fastest way to fail at selling courses. You can have great production, solid marketing, a beautiful platform. If the topic has no demand, you won't sell.

I've seen talented creators spend months on courses nobody wanted. And I've seen others with mediocre content sell thousands because they picked well.

The difference is understanding what people search for and where there's room to compete.

## How to use this list

Each idea includes why it works. But heads up: something being on this list doesn't mean you should do it. You need to validate that your specific audience wants it. More on that at the end.

Ideas are grouped by category. Some are obvious, some less so. All have proven demand in 2025.

## Before you choose

A profitable idea for others might flop for you. Before creating any course, validate:

1. Do you have an audience or access to one?
2. Can you demonstrate credentials or results in the topic?
3. Are people actively searching for this? (Google Trends, forums, social questions)
4. Is anyone paying for similar courses?

If all four answers are yes, you have something. If any is no, think twice.

The best idea combines market demand with something you can teach better than most. That last part is key.
