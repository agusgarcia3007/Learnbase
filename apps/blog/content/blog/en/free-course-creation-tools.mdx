You can create a complete course without paying a cent for software. Seriously.

The problem is there are hundreds of "free" tools and most have hidden catches. Free versions that are useless, watermarks impossible to remove, limits that force you to pay at the worst moment.

This list includes only tools that actually work in their free version. For each one I explain what you can do and where the limits are.

## Screen recording

**OBS Studio**
Free, unlimited, no watermark. The standard for streaming and screen recording. Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Learning curve is somewhat steep but there are tutorials for everything. You can record your screen, camera, or both simultaneously.

**Loom**
Free plan: videos up to 5 minutes, 25 videos maximum. Useful for short feedback videos or quick explanations. For long lessons it's useless unless you pay.

**Screencastify**
Chrome extension. Free plan: 5 minutes per video, watermark. Very limited but can work for short demos.

**QuickTime (Mac)**
Comes with the system. Records screen without limits or watermark. Basic but functional. Doesn't record system audio without additional apps.

Recommended: OBS Studio. Truly free, no compromises.

## Camera video recording

**Your phone's native app**
Free, unlimited. Most modern phones record in 1080p or 4K. Enough quality for any course.

**Open Camera (Android)**
Free, open source. More control than the native app: manual adjustments for exposure, focus, white balance.

**Filmic Pro**
Paid ($15), but I mention it because it's the only app worth paying for if you need professional control. Not free but a one-time purchase, no subscription.

Recommended: your phone's native app works for 90% of cases.

## Video editing

**DaVinci Resolve**
The best kept secret. Professional editing and color correction software, free. The free version has almost everything you need. Used in Hollywood productions. Available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. Requires a computer with some power.

**CapCut**
Free on mobile and desktop. Perfect for quick editing. Cuts, text, transitions, music. The desktop version is surprisingly complete.

**iMovie (Mac)**
Comes free with Mac. Simple, intuitive. Limited in advanced features but enough for basic courses.

**Kdenlive**
Free, open source, cross-platform. Less polished than DaVinci but lighter. Good option if your computer isn't powerful.

**Clipchamp**
Now owned by Microsoft, free with Microsoft account. Browser-based editor, no installation needed. Exports in 1080p without watermark on the free plan.

Recommended: DaVinci Resolve if your computer can handle it, CapCut if you prefer something simpler.

## Audio editing

**Audacity**
Free, open source. The standard for audio editing. Remove noise, normalize volume, cut silences. Outdated interface but works perfectly.

**GarageBand (Mac)**
Free with Mac. More music-oriented but works well for cleaning voice audio.

Recommended: Audacity. Does everything you need.

## Graphic design

**Canva**
Very generous free plan. Thumbnails, presentations, downloadable materials. Thousands of templates. Some photos and elements are paid but there's enough free content.

**Figma**
Free plan for up to 3 projects. More powerful than Canva for custom design. Steeper learning curve but more professional results.

**GIMP**
Free, open source. Photoshop alternative. Powerful but unfriendly interface. Worth it if you need advanced image editing.

**Photopea**
Photoshop in the browser, free. Surprisingly capable. Opens PSD files. Has ads but works.

Recommended: Canva for most people. Figma if you want more control.

## Presentations

**Google Slides**
Free with Google account. Real-time collaboration. Exports to PDF. Limited but functional templates.

**Canva Presentations**
Part of Canva's free plan. Better templates than Google Slides. Present directly from Canva or export.

**LibreOffice Impress**
Free, open source. PowerPoint alternative. Works offline.

Recommended: Google Slides or Canva depending on your visual preference.

## Video hosting

**YouTube (unlisted)**
Free, unlimited. Upload videos as "unlisted" and only those with the link can view them. No fine control over who accesses.

**Vimeo**
Free plan: 500MB per week upload. Better privacy controls than YouTube. Most course platforms integrate with Vimeo.

**Google Drive**
Free up to 15GB. You can share videos with private links. Not a proper video player but it works.

Recommended: YouTube unlisted to start. Vimeo if you need more control.

## Course selling platforms

**Gumroad**
No monthly cost. 10% commission per sale. You can upload videos, PDFs, any file. Sales page included. Limited in course features but works to start.

**Payhip**
No monthly cost. 5% commission per sale. Similar to Gumroad with lower commission.

**Notion + Stripe**
Create the course in Notion (free), charge with Stripe, give access manually. Zero platform commission, only Stripe's commission (2.9% + 30 cents). More manual work but zero fixed cost.

**Teachable (free plan)**
Exists but has serious limitations: 10% commission + $1 per sale, PayPal only, no custom domain. I don't recommend it.

Recommended: Gumroad or Payhip to start. No fixed cost, you only pay if you sell.

## Student communication

**Discord**
Free. Communities with text and voice channels. Many creators use it for support and course community.

**Slack**
Free plan with 90-day message history limit. Works but the history limit is annoying.

**WhatsApp/Telegram groups**
Free, familiar to everyone. Simple but doesn't scale well. Works for small groups.

Recommended: Discord if you want community. Email if you prefer keeping it simple.

## Automation and email

**Mailchimp**
Free up to 500 contacts. Enough to start. Limits automations on free plan.

**MailerLite**
Free up to 1000 subscribers. More generous than Mailchimp on automations.

**Brevo (formerly Sendinblue)**
Free up to 300 emails per day. No contact limit. Good if you have a large list but send infrequently.

Recommended: MailerLite if you're starting out. Better free automations.

## The minimum viable stack

If you start today with zero budget:

1. Recording: phone's native app + OBS for screen
2. Editing: CapCut or DaVinci Resolve
3. Audio: Audacity
4. Design: Canva
5. Hosting: YouTube unlisted
6. Sales: Gumroad
7. Email: MailerLite

Total cost: $0

With this stack you can create, host, and sell a complete course. Limitations exist but they don't prevent you from starting.

## When paying makes sense

Free tools work up to a point. Consider paying when:

- Your time is worth more than the savings (editing in DaVinci takes 3x longer than a simple paid editor)
- You need features that don't exist free (private video hosting with real protection)
- Work volume justifies it (thousands of email subscribers, dozens of videos)
- The watermark or limitation affects perceived quality

Until then, everything on this list works to create your first course with no budget excuses.
